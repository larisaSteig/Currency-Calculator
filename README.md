# Currency Calculator

Problem Statement 

The goal of this project is to create a user form from the ground up that will enable one to use real-time exchange rates to convert currency from one unit to another. It automates a data query in Excel and links the results to an easy-to-use VBA user form. The default date for the currency exchange is the current date, but the user can enter any historical date (within reason) to obtain the exchange rates/converted values for times in the past. Finally, the user form should generate a plot of exchange rates over the past 30 days. 

The workflow of the project was the following:

Open website and pull information regarding currency exchange rates based on date entry in user form.
Pull information into Excel
Perform calculation
Plot data if needed
